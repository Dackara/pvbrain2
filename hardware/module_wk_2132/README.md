## [WK 2132 :](../main/hardware/module_wk_2132)
Before discovering the WK2168 module which allowed the creation of the card above, a DIY version of the DFRobot [DFR0627](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2001.html) had been designed.<br/>
Its cost is a little lower than its big brother the WK2168, but it only allows 2 additional UARTs.
