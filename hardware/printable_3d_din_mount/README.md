[3D Files](https://github.com/Dackara/Fil_Pilote/blob/main/Hardware/3D_Print) to print, created by <sub>[![Dackara](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dackara-black?logo=git&style=flat)](https://github.com/Dackara)</sub>, for mounting addon cards on DIN rail <sup>(electrical panel)</sup>.<br/>
A plastic card in the same format as the addon cards which can, for example, allow circuit isolation, is also available.
