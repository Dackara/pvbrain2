# To initiate communication with Pylontech batteries for the first time, or, 
# after a complete shutdown of the system, it is necessary to send a 
# command line at 2400 baud, before switching to 115200 baud.

# So you need to set the baud_rate to 2400, send the command by 
# pressing the button, then set the baud_rate back to 115200.
