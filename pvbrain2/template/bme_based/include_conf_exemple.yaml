# This file adds 3 sensors to you: altitude (relative to sea level), dew_point and pressure_sea_level_equivalent

packages:
  my_templated_bme_280_1: !include
    file: pvbrain2/template/bme_based/template_bme_based.yaml
    vars:
      bme_280_name: 'bme280'           # Must be identical to that of your BME280
      bme_update_interval: '5s'        # Refresh interval
      bme_280_my_fix_altitude: '26'    # Your altitude in Meters. To calculate the equivalent pressure at sea level, it must be fixed.
