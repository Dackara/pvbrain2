# This code allows you to control your light teleruptor from the ESP or
# your frontend (eg: HomeAssistant) via 3 control modes 'light', 'switch'
# and 'button', the state of the first two obtains the real state of the 
# litter (on or off).

    vars:
      teleruptor_name: 'teleruptor_1'                    # The name of your Teleruptor
      binary_disabled: 'true'                            # Disables 2 binary sensors by defaut, but they can be activated in the frontend
      # Input / To Optocouplor - Binary_sensor (light circuit):
      teleruptor_input_binary_sensor_id: 'wk_binary1'    # ID of the Binary_sensor to detect 230v presence
      # Output / To Teleruptor - Relay card (button circuit):
      teleruptor_output_button_id: 'sx1_output1'         # ID of the Output to controle the teleruptor
