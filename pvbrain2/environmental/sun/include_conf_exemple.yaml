      sun_latitude: !secret my_latitude        # Personally I prefer to place this information in my "secrets.yaml" folder 
      sun_longitude: !secret my_longitude      # but you can just as easily enter it hard here (eg: sun_latitude: '44.33334')

# If you choose to use "!secret" you must then place the following lines 
# in your "secrets.yaml" file placed at the root of esphome, obviously 
# replacing the GPS coordinates with yours.

# my_latitude: '44.33334'
# my_longitude: '2.60620'
