# Also, if you do not use the 4 ASD1115 (only one for example) you can 
# add these lines (replacing "${ads1115_name}" with the name of your ADS1115) 
# so as not to have an error in the log:

# ads1115:
#   - id: !remove ${ads1115_name}_hub1
#   - id: !remove ${ads1115_name}_hub2
#   - id: !remove ${ads1115_name}_hub3
